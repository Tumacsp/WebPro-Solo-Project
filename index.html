          <h2 style="text-align: center">What is PHP</h2>
          <p style="text-align: center">
            PHP is an open-source, server-side programming language that can be
            used to create websites, applications, customer relationship
            management systems and more. <br />It is a widely-used
            general-purpose language that can be embedded into HTML. This
            functionality with HTML means that the PHP language has remained
            popular with developers as it helps to simplify HTML code.
          </p>

        <div class="info_div">
          <h2>What does PHP stand for?</h2>
          <p style="text-align: center">
            PHP stands for ‘PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor’, with the original PHP
            within this standing for ‘Personal Home Page’. <br /><br />The
            acronym has changed as the language developed since its launch in
            1994 to more accurately reflect its nature.

            <br /><br />Since its release, there have been 8 versions of PHP, as
            of 2022, with version 8.1 currently a popular choice among those
            using the language on their websites.

          <h2 style="text-align: center">What is PHP used for?</h2>
          <p style="text-align: center">
            PHP programming can be used to create most things that a software
            developer needs. However, there are three main areas in which it
            thrives.

              </p>
              <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px">
                Server-side Script is PHP’s main strength. If you are just
                learning to code and want to explore server-side scripting, PHP
                is a great language to learn. <br /><br />To get cracking with
                PHP server-side scripting you’ll need to have a PHP parser, web
                server and web browser.

              </p>
              <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px">
                Command-line scripting is ideal for scripts made using cron
                (Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows). It is also great for simple
                text processing.

                PHP is probably not the best language to use to create desktop
                applications but for the advanced web developer, it provides you
                with many more options than its competitors.

              <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px">
                The parser takes PHP code and analyses it, outputting a
                respective syntax tree that puts the source into an easier to

          <h2 style="text-align: center">Advantages of PHP</h2>
          <p style="text-align: center">
            PHP has endured as a popular programming language for almost three
            decades owing to the number of benefits it offers users and
            developers. The most significant of these are:
          </p>
          <br />

          <ul style="text-align: left">
            <li>
              It is cross-platform: As mentioned above, PHP can be run on any
              major operating system, This also means that you dont have to worry about
              members being able to access code!
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              It’s open-source: Open source means that PHP is a free programming
              language, so you don’t have to worry about additional costs when
              building your project
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Many developers understand it: The longevity of PHP means there’s
              already a large community out there to support you, and a large
              amount of legacy code to help you get started with projects.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              It works brilliantly with HTML: PHP can help simplify your
              projects and works seamlessly with this dominant programming
              language.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              As a language, it is relatively easy to learn: Because of its
              simplicity, PHP is quicker and easier to pick up than some other
              alternatives.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              There are plenty of tools available: There are tools to help you
              with just about anything for PHP, from integration, code hinting,
              syntax highlighting and more, there is a lot of support for you.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              It offers great load times for websites: With website performance
              becoming more and more tied to speed, PHP’s quick load can really
              help you succeed.
            </li>
